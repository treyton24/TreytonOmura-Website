        .Going up my dad would often talk to me a lot about business marketing which made me want to go into that profession so as a kid my entire goal was to become something like my dad but I realized that I needed more than him.I attended UCR for my education because it was a the school that I really wanted to get into.  I took my major as business and then later specialize in marketing because I knew I would need those skills later in my life and in my job. I would want to have later in my life school was tough but I persevered through it while having part-time jobs every single year and with the help of my dad I got a job as an intern at his workplace. As a young kid I got an early job as an entrepreneur if my dad working under him, but I've often realized that I could do more of myself so I stay with my dad I got all the skills that I would need and then I moved on to a bigger company call Palo Alto Networks but after I realize that I was not really learning much from the people around me I realized, but I need to do a start my own company. To realize what was really needed, I side of my own company called pumps Which was an eco-friendly Yogurtland style station.  I really like how I was able to use all my skills to I've left my previous employers and Implement them into my own business and then see my own business succeed. Now have benches across the United States although we are specific in California, we have extended out to as far as Florida.  we have succeeded from becoming a no one to know name to a common household name and now we are looking to expand into other areas and businesses such as apparel, toothpaste, and maybe even the ocean.  although there have been many troubles along the way such as funding costs cutting people off inflation and other government issues we have been able to overcome them and become an even better company because of those  problems.We have now been reached out by multiple companies and are planning to make to Joint projects and reach out the fortnite and have a branding with them but we don't know why we're going to do that yet but we will see what God has in store for us we also are interested in seeing how our products can do overseas such as in other countries such as turkey Japan and other major countries I am proud of what we have become because we have started from nothing and have to come to something. Although we have reached a very high achievement we are not doing anything yet and this is only the beginning because I believe this company can grow into a monopoly and we can own much more than what we already do
